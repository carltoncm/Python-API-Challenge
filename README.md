# Python-API-Challenge
This repository is my submission for the Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 6 Challenge. 

The final code is included in the WeatherPy folder, while the requested outputs are in the output_data folder.

I referenced code from class presented by instructor Brett Barnes and TA Ally Qi (activities, PowerPoints, resources, etc.). 

I also referenced the following sites to build my code:
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.copy.html,
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/udf/pandas
